# PySpark_Hadoop_Data_Transform

 The following project uses a CRM DataWarehouse db to perform a consolidation on the Fact transaction table and a Product Dimension table
using PySpark and does several transformations on DataTypes and columns in order to make the transition to Data Analysis tools for Business Analysis via Hive.

In this case we've used PowerBI to show Sales performance by Unit Price Category, Color Item Category, Top Product Sales by Month And KPI performance from previous
Sales month.
